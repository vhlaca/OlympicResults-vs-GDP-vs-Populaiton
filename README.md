# OlympicResults-vs-GDP-vs-Population
The goal is to compare results on olympic games from 1994 till 2016 with parameters like:
- number of participants
- GDP
- number of inhabitants

The idea is to get real feel how successful a country is in realistic circumstances.

## This is work in progress

## athlete_events.7z should be unpacked (it is larger then size limitation)
